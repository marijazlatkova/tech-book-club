## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vue 3 + Vite
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This is my first project built with Vue, and it helped me understand component structure, props, scoped styles, and organizing files using Vite. I also improved my plain CSS, semantic HTML, mobile-first layout, and accessibility skills, including smooth scroll and hover states.
